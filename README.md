Hello Everyone. 

This is the link to the webpage I created for our Lab #4. 

Link: https://aquinoschoolwork.github.io/lab-4/

There is a mention of a slight improvement needed which is to lower the size of some images. I did lower the size where quality is not impacted as much and lowering it down would improve some performance but quality would drop which I dont believe is worth the trade off. 

Thank you!
